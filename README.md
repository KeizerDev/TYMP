#Tymp
Also called "The Youtube Music Player", this fan made app has to act like you expect to play normal music.

###Goal:
Search youtube and stream directly or store the videoid with some ID3 tags gathered from musicbrainz or something store it in a local db so you can find it easily and it looks beautifull in your **Tymp** queue.

###Milestones:
1. [ ] Search youtube and "music" in the music player.
2. [ ] Search youtube and choose to play it right away or add it to queue.
3. [ ] Create local db with extra track information if user wanted to.
4. [ ] Make playlists.
