Also called "The Youtube Music Player", this fan made app has to act like you expect to play normal music.  

###Goal:
Search youtube and stream it as music or store the videoid, with some extra track information from musicbrainz (or something else), in a local DB so you can find it back easily. I has to act perfectly as a music player with YouTube as music source.  

###Milestones:
1. [X] Add videos to local db and stream them like a song.
2. [ ] Create a decent music player and UI. 
3. [ ] Search youtube and "music" in the music player.
4. [ ] Search youtube and choose to play it right away or add it to queue.
5. [ ] Create local db with extra track information if user wanted to.
6. [ ] Make playlists.
